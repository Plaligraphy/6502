printVals()
Prints all registers and memory for display using System.out

getUserInput()
Using Scanner, fetches user input and puts in lowercase for future handling

parseUserInput()
Takes info from getUserInput() and checks against preset conditions for parseable commands
ST commands are seperate from the main switch statement
STs are first split from their formatted (Ex: stx,0) into two seperate strings for parsing
Both strings then get whitespaces removed for completness using removeWhitespace()
Finally, a setMemory() call is made with var for register selection and locale being set to the 2nd split String

setMemory(int var, int locale)
Sets memory conditions according to the “memsize” variable
locale selected which piece of memory (which part of the Array) to place the registers data
var selects which register the data is going to be pulled from

checkInterrupts()
Detects interrupt codes in memory using if w/&

getA,getX,getY
Gets the, respective, A,X,Y variable when called

setA, setX,setY
Sets the, respective A,X,Y and takes a Integer to set to

removeWhitespace()
Uses replaceAll with the “\\s” command to remove whitespaces from strings
